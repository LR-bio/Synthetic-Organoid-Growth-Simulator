# Synthetic-Organoid-Growth-Simulator
# BioLogic

BioLogic is a synthetic biology-inspired logic circuit compiler and visualizer.  
It translates Boolean logic gates into biological genetic circuit parts and visualizes their relationships as graphs.

## Features

- Define logic circuits with AND, OR, NOT, NAND, XOR gates  
- Translate logic gates to genetic parts (promoters, repressors, reporters)  
- Export a simple GenBank-style text representation  
- Visualize circuits using network graphs  
- Unit tested and CI-enabled  

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
